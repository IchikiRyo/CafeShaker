=== kgio 2.11.1 - fix Ruby 2.5.0dev compatibility / 2017-12-15 19:40 UTC

  This release fixes compatibility with Ruby 2.5.0 preview and
  release candidates (and thus should be ready for 2.5.0 final)
  on some platforms.  At least clang 5.0.0 on OpenBSD is affected.

  Thanks to Jeremy Evans for the fix.

  There's also minor documentation updates since 2.11.0
